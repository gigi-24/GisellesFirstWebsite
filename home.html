            <p> Maternal mortality is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy according to WHO(World Health Organization). Maternal mortality can also occur up to one year postpartum.  The death occurs due to a pregnancy-related health issue or pre-existing condition that causes complications during or after the pregnancy. Maternal mortality also occurs due to lack of attention during pregnancy. According to CDC data, approximately 33% of maternal deaths occur from 1 week to 1 year after birth.<br> Contributing factors leading to maternal mortality are illnesses such as postpartum hemorrhage, heart-related illnesses, hypertension, comorbidities, and diabetes. Fetal death occurs due to the fetus showing no sign of life as indicated by heartbeats, absence of breathing,  or pulsation of the umbilical cord. There are many factors contributing to fetal death such as pregnancy complications, maternal issues, and placental issues. The United States has the highest rates of fetal and maternal mortality due to contributing factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, systemic health disparities, an undersupply of maternity providers, especially midwives, and lack of access to comprehensive postpartum support, including maternity care coverage and mandated paid maternity leave. <br>In the navigation bar you may click information to learn more about the contributing factors leading to the rising rates. The survey is linked down below and your respond would be greatly appreciated. The purpose of this survey is to collect data to improve the quality care mothers recieve and to reduce alarming rates.
